# Description
This is a sample project which calculates the measurements like Max, Min, Median, Normalization, and 90th percentile of a huge dataset.
Without using Hadoop MapReduce, this process will need too much time. By using features like combiner in MapReduce, we
can minimize the execution time of processing.
